# Syntax History

[![build](https://travis-ci.org/malexer/SyntaxHistory.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/malexer/SyntaxHistory)

Syntax History is a plugin for Sublime Text 3 which stores the history
of syntax used for files and apply it when files are reopened.

It detects when syntax is applied to the file by user, saves it in
a config file and then use this syntax again when file is reopened.


# Install

Install using Package Control:

1. Package Control: Install Package
2. Select by name `Syntax History`


# Usage

Nothing special, just apply syntax manually to file when it is not
detected or detected incorrectly. Next time openning this file you
should see correct syntax applied.
